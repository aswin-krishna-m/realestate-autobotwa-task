## Short Notes: Vercel v0 Usage

- The **Hero Section** layout and background overlay design were generated using Vercel v0 and later adapted for responsiveness.  
- The **Features Section** (4-column grid with icons) was created using v0 to speed up the UI structure.  
- The **Property Highlights** cards were generated with v0 and then enhanced with hover effects and custom images.  
- The **Contact Form** UI was generated using v0 and integrated with Tailwind form styling.  
- The **Footer layout** (4-column) was also generated using v0 and customized for branding.  
- Responsiveness, spacing, animations, and Next.js component structure were manually refined to complete the final landing page.
